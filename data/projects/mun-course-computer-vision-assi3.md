# Optical Flow Analysis and Frame Interpolation

## Project Overview

This project my assignment 3 for Computer Vision course. This project implements and analyzes various optical flow estimation techniques for computer vision applications. The implementation includes multiple approaches to calculate optical flow between image pairs, along with frame interpolation capabilities. The project demonstrates strong understanding of computer vision concepts, Python programming, and image processing techniques.

## Key Features

- Ground truth flow visualization using FlowPy
- Multi-channel optical flow computation using Farnebäck's algorithm
- Comparative analysis of different color channels (RGB, Green, Grayscale)
- Forward and backward flow estimation
- Middle frame interpolation using optical flow
- Lucas-Kanade optical flow implementation
- Comprehensive error analysis using End-Point Error (EPE) metrics

## Technical Implementation

The project is implemented in Python and leverages several key computer vision libraries:

- OpenCV (cv2) for image processing and optical flow computation
- FlowPy for flow visualization and file handling
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Matplotlib for visualization
