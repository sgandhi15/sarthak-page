# Health Card API

## Project Overview

A robust and secure REST API backend for a digital Health Card system that facilitates seamless interaction between patients, doctors, and administrators. This system modernizes healthcare management by digitizing medical records and streamlining healthcare service delivery.

## Key Features

- **Multi-User Role System**: Separate interfaces and functionalities for patients, doctors, and administrators
- **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system with role-based access control
- **Patient Management**: Digital health records, appointment scheduling, and medical history tracking
- **Doctor Portal**: Patient management, appointment handling, and medical record updates
- **Admin Dashboard**: System oversight, user management, and platform administration
- **RESTful Architecture**: Well-structured API endpoints following REST principles
- **Robust Security**: Implementation of security best practices using Helmet.js and JWT

## Technical Stack

- **Runtime Environment**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with bcryptjs
- **Security Middleware**:
  - Helmet.js for security headers
  - CORS for cross-origin resource sharing
  - Morgan for HTTP request logging
- **Development Tools**:
  - Nodemon for hot-reloading during development
  - Cross-env for environment variable management
  - Dotenv for configuration management

## API Endpoints

### Patient Routes

- Authentication and profile management
- Medical record access and management
- Appointment scheduling and tracking

### Doctor Routes

- Patient record management
- Appointment handling
- Medical history updates

### Admin Routes

- User management (patients and doctors)
- System configuration
- Access control management

### Common Routes

- Shared functionalities
- General system endpoints
- Public information access

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
   ```
   PORT=your_port
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```
4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development Scripts

- `npm start`: Start the production server
- `npm run dev`: Run the development server with hot-reloading
- `npm test`: Run the test suite (to be implemented)

## Security Features

- Secure password hashing using bcryptjs
- Protected routes with JWT authentication
- Security headers with Helmet.js
- CORS protection
- Request logging and monitoring

_Note: This is a backend API project. For the complete health card system, a separate frontend application would need to be connected to these endpoints._
